            <li>4 (6 oz each) salmon filets</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp smoked paprika (or regular paprika)</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp blackening seasoning (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Sauce</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic minced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
            <li>3 tbsp water</li>
            <li>3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>3 tbsp sriracha sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Pat salmon dry, then season with salt, pepper, paprika and blackening seasoning (if using)</li>
            <li>Adjust oven rack to middle position, then preheat broiler. If you broil this with the rack up high the sauce will burn</li>

            <li>Add salmon, skin side down (if using salmon with skin), and cook 3 minutes. While salmon cooks, baste frequently with sauce from the pan by spooning it over the top of the salmon</li>
            <li>Broil salmon for 5-6 minutes, basting with sauce once during the broil, until salmon is caramelized and cooked to desired doneness</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy</li>
