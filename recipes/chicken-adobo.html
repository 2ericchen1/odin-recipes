       This recipe showcases the delightful flavors of Filipino Chicken Adobo with a twist of Kapow. Tender chicken pieces are marinated in a harmonious blend of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and spices, allowing them to absorb the rich and tangy marinade. The chicken is then seared to perfection, creating a mouthwatering caramelization. As it simmers in the savory sauce, the meat becomes incredibly succulent and infused with the aromatic seasonings. The dish is beautifully balanced with a touch of sweetness, making it an irresistible feast for the senses. Paired with steamed rice, this Filipino Chicken Adobo Kapow is sure to captivate your taste buds with its vibrant and enticing flavors.
       <h3 class="fancy">Ingredients</h3>
       <h4 class="luck">Chicken and Marinade</h4>
       <ul>
        <li>1.5 lb chicken thigh fillets</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1/3 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/3 cup white vinegar</li>
        <li>4 bay leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="luck">For Cooking</h5>
        <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 small brown onion</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>2 tbsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp whole black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h6 class="luck">Serving</h6>
        <ul>
        <li>2 green onions</li>
        </ul>
       <h7 class="fancy">Steps</h7>
        <ol>
        <li>Combine Chicken and Marinade ingredients in a bowl. Marinate for at least 20 minutes, or up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over high heat. Remove chicken from marinade (reserve marinade) and place in the pan. Sear both sides until browned â€“ about 1 minute on each side. Do not cook the chicken all the way through</li>
        <li>Remove chicken skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining oil in skillet. Add garlic and onion, cook 1 1/2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the reserved marinade, water, sugar and black pepper. Bring it to a simmer then turn heat down to medium high. Simmer 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add chicken smooth side down. Simmer uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes (no need to stir), turning chicken at around 15 minutes, until the sauce reduces down to a thick jam-like syrup</li>
        <li>If the sauce isn't thick enough, remove chicken onto a plate and let the sauce simmer by itself - it will thicken much quicker - then return chicken to the skillet to coat in the glaze</li>
        <li>Coat chicken in glaze then serve over rice</li>
       </ol>
